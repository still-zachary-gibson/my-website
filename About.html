			<p>This is the page where I kinda just talk about myself a bit, so I can't really blame you if you'd much rather<br>not bother to read this page. Frankly, probably a better use of your time, but I suppose if you really<br>want to, them this is the page to go to!</p>

			<p>So, who am I? Not sure why you're asking me as if I know, but my name's Zachary Gibson.<br>Currently a Junior, but about to be a Senior. I'm a big fan of computers, mostly stuff like coding and<br>software to pick the stuff I'm most into. I also enjoy reading, swimming, and have a dog who's<br>only kind of a massive jerk most of the time. I kid, he's great and I love him a lot.<br><br>I'm the type of person who's basically always working, except for when my case of<br>executive disfunction says no to me, and I kinda just sadly slink away.<br>But that's besides the point, I like doing things, plain and simple.<br>Usually stuff relating to programming and/or game development, but really anything that<br>occupies time works, because if I don't have things I'm doing...<br>My brain's not really a fan of that, and that's not a fun time.<br><br>I also enjoy playing games of quite a few kinds, though my tastes can be<br>a bit all over the place really. I've also worked on a few games, such as the<br>ones you can find in the <a href="JSGallery.html">JS Gallery</a>, and as part of a team on multiple<br>projects that are either dead, not having much go on, or other states of general<br>"probably not going to be finished"ness, due to how teamwork is hard.<br>But that's just the way things go!<br><br>I've also been in a few competitions, such as the SkillsUSA one,<br>where I didn't place dead last, so that's certainly something.<br><br>I might not be the best at peopling, but I try my best to be nice, and to<br>help people out whenever I can. Even if sometimes I suck at doing<br>both of those things, but I try my best.<br><br>I have no clue what else to put here, despite the fact there's probably loads more<br>to mention, but I say we can call it here. Bye!</p>
