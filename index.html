			<!-- <p>Now, you might be wondering, just what the heck is this website?</p><p>Well, obviously, I'm gonna tell you that!<br>It'd be kinda rude of me to just not do that, after all, so let's<br>just get into this site, alrighty?</p>
			<p>So, this is for my main adventure! The HTML and CSS website one,<br>I mean, not the Coding Project, despite how my Tetris website<br>game thingy may seem, this one's a genuine, no extra tools,<br>good old fashioned website.</p><p>Pure HTML and CSS, baby!</p><p>Well, maybe some JS too, but not here, so shh.<p>
			<a href="navi.html">Now let's get to the main navigation page!</a>
			<p>Hmm, might also make this an actual site, but we'll see how<br>this winds up, if it's good enough to convert into<br>something people might actually see.</p>	-->
			<h1 style="text-align:center">Hey, welcome to my website!</h1>
			<p>This site was made as part of a project for a class, but I decided to use it as<br>an actual website to put up here as well. I mean, I've already got it set up, I might<br>as well reuse it afterwards, that's one of the three Rs!</p>
			<p>I'm not sure if I'll update this site too much after today, but that doesn't mean you can't<br>visit the <a href="navi.html">Navigation Page</a> to see what's here to see!</p>
			<p>This site's not too advanced, but it should do the job for being a website.<br>It's doing better than not existing at all would do, so that's good enough for me, I think.<br>Hopefully, it's good enough for you too!</p>
